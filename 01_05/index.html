        <h2>Design & Arts</h2>
        <p>Just a little boy who likes arts and design. I'm not saying I'm good at anything I'm doing, but I have fun doing it. That being said, you can make yourself your own picture about my stuff with the following links:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen to my music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/itsjeve" title="My SoundCloud" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>!</li>
          <li>See some of my other art on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jestery.b/" title="My instagram" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!</li>
          <li>All my other stuff is either not good enough to be shared or I simply didn't upload it anywhere!</li>
